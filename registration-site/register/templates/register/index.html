<h2>About Open Humans</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/">Open Humans</a> is a nonprofit
  project that has been funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and
  Knight Foundation. Their platform enables members to aggregate data and
  share data with researchers and citizen scientists.
</p>
<p>
  Data is private by default in Open Humans. You choose when to share.
  Members can decide to make data public, or can contribute it directly
  (and privately) to projects created by researchers and citizen
  scientists.

<h2>Technical details</h2>
<p>
  This app does not receive access to any identifying information from
  your Open Humans account. The only information that is received and
  stored is an anonymous Open Humans member ID, and the authentication
  details required for the application to regularly push files to your
  Open Humans account. Data is deposited using these details and the
  apps <a href="{{ oh_proj_page }}">associated transfer activity</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Raw data is JSON format, retrieved from your Nightscout server. You'll
  have access to data files in the Open Humans activity page:
